# PCard
This is a repository for the PCard Case.

The data in the _Pickle Data_ folder has a compression format of _xz_. Thus, to read in the data for 2010 using pandas, use this code: `df1 = pd.read_pickle('https://github.com/RonGuymon/PCard/blob/main/Pickle%20Data/PCard_Data%20FY2010.p?raw=true', compression = 'xz')`
